# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Project: Credit Card Fraud Detection

Description:

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset of credit card transactions. The dataset contains 284,807 rows and 31 features, including the target variable (Class) which indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).

Dataset:

The dataset used in this project is the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset from Kaggle. The dataset can be downloaded from the following URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

Files:

creditcard.csv: The Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset.

script.py: The Python script that loads the dataset, performs exploratory data analysis, and trains a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions.

Instructions:

Download the creditcard.csv dataset from Kaggle and place it in the same directory as the script.py file.

Run the script.py file using Python 3.x.

The script will load the dataset, perform exploratory data analysis, and train a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions.

Dependences:

Python 3.x

PyTorch

pandas

scikit-learn

torch.optim

torch.nn

Todo:

Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Train a machine learning model (e.g., neural network, decision tree, random forest) to detect fraudulent transactions.

Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Note:

This README file will be updated as the project progresses.
